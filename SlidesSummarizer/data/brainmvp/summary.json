"{\n  \"content_summary\": \"The paper introduces BrainMVP, a multi-modal vision pre-training framework for brain image analysis using multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans. The motivation is to enhance the diagnosis of brain abnormalities by leveraging complementary multi-parametric MRI data, addressing the limitations of single-modality approaches. BrainMVP aims to develop a universal pre-training model that can adapt to various clinical scenarios, particularly by handling missing modalities and achieving robust multi-modal information fusion. The framework is evaluated on a large dataset of 16,022 brain MRI scans from multiple centers, covering eight MRI modalities, and demonstrates superior performance in segmentation and classification tasks.\",\n  \"contribution\": [\n    \"First multi-modal vision pre-training framework to align features across different MRI modalities, addressing the challenge of missing modality data.\",\n    \"Introduction of novel proxy tasks: cross-modal reconstruction and modality-aware contrastive learning, enhancing the model's ability to generalize across modalities.\",\n    \"Compilation of a comprehensive dataset of 16,022 brain MRI scans, supporting robust pre-training and evaluation.\",\n    \"Innovative use of modality-wise data distillation to create condensed templates, improving consistency and generalization across diverse MRI types.\"\n  ],\n  \"method\": [\n    \"Cross-modal reconstruction: Learns shared representations by masking and mixing modalities, enabling the model to handle missing data.\",\n    \"Modality-wise data distillation: Creates condensed modality templates to guide pre-training and enhance feature consistency.\",\n    \"Modality-aware contrastive learning: Ensures semantic consistency across modalities by focusing on relationships between different MRI types.\",\n    \"Implementation: Uses a BrainMVP encoder for feature extraction and separate task heads for segmentation and classification.
